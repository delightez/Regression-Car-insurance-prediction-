# Regression-Car-insurance-prediction-
I wrote a python code to predict car insurance amounts claims, using both simple linear regression and multiple linear regression.
The aim was to be able to predict if a person would defualt on a loan if given one, based on variables like age , salary.
The dataset is of indian scope( i.e its is made up of indians only) and i used scit-learn.
